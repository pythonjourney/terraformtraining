Demonstrating AWS Route 53, VPC, Load Balancer, and SSL Integration with Terraform


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36394360-7b1c-4a79-a01e-0cf9716635ba)


This guide provides a detailed overview of AWS services like Route 53, VPC, Load Balancer, and Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) for SSL/TLS. We'll also walk through creating the infrastructure depicted in the architecture diagram using Terraform. This article is tailored for students and professionals looking to understand these services and their integration.

Overview of the Architecture

Key Components:

Route 53: Amazon's DNS web service used to route traffic to the appropriate resources.

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): A logically isolated network for deploying AWS resources.

Internet Gateway: Provides internet access to resources in the VPC.

Public Subnet: A subnet accessible from the internet, hosting the application server.

Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, enhancing scalability and availability.

Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM): Provides SSL/TLS certificates for securing traffic.

EC2 Instance: A virtual server running the application.

Services Breakdown

1. Route 53

Purpose: Domain registration and DNS traffic routing.

Functionality:

Associates your domain name (e.g., example.com) with the load balancerâ€™s DNS name.

Supports health checks for failover.

2. VPC

Purpose: Isolated network environment for resources.

Components:

Internet Gateway: Allows public internet access.

Subnets: Logical partitions of the VPC.

Route Tables: Direct traffic to/from subnets and the internet gateway.

3. Load Balancer

Purpose: Distributes incoming requests across multiple instances to ensure high availability.

Type Used: Application Load Balancer (ALB).

4. Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)

Purpose: Secures traffic using SSL/TLS certificates.

Integration:

The SSL certificate is attached to the Load Balancer to handle HTTPS traffic.

5. EC2 Instance

Purpose: Hosts the application.

Placement: In a public subnet with access managed by security groups.
